Common Problems and Solutions

Problem: "My site shows a README instead of my webpage"
Solution: Make sure your main HTML file is named index.html

Problem: "My images are not showing up"
Solution: Check that image file paths are correct and use relative paths.
Use this:
-->
<img src="/images/photo.jpg" alt="My photo">
<!--
Not this:
-->
<!-- <img src="C:/Users/me/Project/images/photo.jpg" alt="My photo"> -->
<!--

Problem: "My CSS is not loading"
Solution: Make sure your link tag uses a relative path:
-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<!--
Not an absolute path from your computer.
