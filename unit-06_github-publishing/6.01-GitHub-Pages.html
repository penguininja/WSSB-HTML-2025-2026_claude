6.01 Lesson

What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a free hosting service from GitHub that turns a repository
into a live website. Any HTML, CSS, and image files you push to GitHub
can become a real website anyone can visit.

Your site will have a URL like:
  https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/

Why use GitHub Pages?
- It is completely free
- Your site is live on the internet for anyone to visit
- It updates automatically when you push changes
- No server setup or payment required
- Great for portfolios, class projects, and personal sites

What you need before starting:
- A GitHub account (https://github.com)
- A project folder with at least one HTML file named index.html
-->

<!--
Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you do not already have one:
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose a username, enter your email, and create a password
4. Verify your account and complete the setup

Tip: Pick a professional username — it will be part of your website URL.
For example, if your username is "jsmith2025", your site will be at:
  https://jsmith2025.github.io/my-website/
-->

Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (for example: "my-website")
4. Make sure "Public" is selected (GitHub Pages requires a public repo on free accounts)
5. Do NOT check "Add a README file" — we will push our existing files
6. Click "Create repository"

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions.
Keep this page open — you will need the commands in the next step.

<!--
Step 3: Create the homepage.

Add index.html for your first test.
Your project folder should have a structure like the following:

  my-website/
    index.html
    style.css
    images/
      photo.jpg

Important: The main HTML file MUST be named index.html
GitHub Pages looks for index.html as the homepage of your site.
If your file is named something else, rename it to index.html
-->

<!--
Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Find and click the "Settings" link
3. Find and click the "Pages" link
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Under "Branch", select "main" and keep the folder as "/ (root)"
6. Click "Save"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for your site to build

GitHub will show you a message with your live URL:
  https://yourusername.github.io/my-website/

Click the link to see your published website.
