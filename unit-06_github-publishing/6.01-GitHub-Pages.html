6.01 Lesson

What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a free hosting service from GitHub that turns a repository
into a live website. Any HTML, CSS, and image files you push to GitHub
can become a real website anyone can visit.

Your site will have a URL like:
  https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/

Why use GitHub Pages?
- It is completely free
- Your site is live on the internet for anyone to visit
- It updates automatically when you push changes
- No server setup or payment required
- Great for portfolios, class projects, and personal sites

What you need before starting:
- A GitHub account (https://github.com)
- A project folder with at least one HTML file named index.html
-->

<!--
Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you do not already have one:
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose a username, enter your email, and create a password
4. Verify your account and complete the setup

Tip: Pick a professional username — it will be part of your website URL.
For example, if your username is "jsmith2025", your site will be at:
  https://jsmith2025.github.io/my-website/
-->

Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Find the "Create New" button (it looks like a "+" icon in the top right corner)
3. Select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (for example: "my-website")
4. Make sure "Public" is selected (GitHub Pages requires a public repo on free accounts)
5. Do NOT check "Add a README file" — we will push our existing files
6. Click "Create repository"

-->

<!--
Step 3: Create the homepage.

1. Find the "Quick Setup" heading and click "Creating a new file"
2. Name the file "index.html" (you may need to find the "breadcrumbs")
3. In the main textarea, add a simple message such as "Hello World" in an h1 tag
(Tip: use the "E" button on JAWS to quickly move between textareas on the page)
3. Click "Commit changes"
4. Enter a message describing what you did, like "add a message to my first webpage"

Important: The main HTML file MUST be named index.html
GitHub Pages looks for index.html as the homepage of your site.
If your file is named something else, rename it to index.html
-->

<!--
Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Find and click the "Settings" link (in the "Repository Navigation Region" on JAWS)
3. Find and click the "Pages" link
4. Under the "Build and deployment" heading set "Branch" to "main" and keep the folder as "/ (root)"
6. Click "Save"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for your site to build

GitHub will show you a message with your live URL (or refresh the page):
  https://yourusername.github.io/my-website/

Click the link to see your published website.
