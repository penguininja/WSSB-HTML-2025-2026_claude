6.01 Lesson

What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a free hosting service from GitHub that turns a repository
into a live website. Any HTML, CSS, and image files you push to GitHub
can become a real website anyone can visit.

Your site will have a URL like:
  https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/

Why use GitHub Pages?
- It is completely free
- Your site is live on the internet for anyone to visit
- It updates automatically when you push changes
- No server setup or payment required
- Great for portfolios, class projects, and personal sites

What you need before starting:
- A GitHub account (https://github.com)
- Git installed on your computer
- A project folder with at least one HTML file named index.html
-->

<!--
Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you do not already have one:
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose a username, enter your email, and create a password
4. Verify your account and complete the setup

Tip: Pick a professional username — it will be part of your website URL.
For example, if your username is "jsmith2025", your site will be at:
  https://jsmith2025.github.io/my-website/
-->

<!--
Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (for example: "my-website")
4. Make sure "Public" is selected (GitHub Pages requires a public repo on free accounts)
5. Do NOT check "Add a README file" — we will push our existing files
6. Click "Create repository"

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions.
Keep this page open — you will need the commands in the next step.
-->

<!--
Step 3: Prepare Your Project Folder

Your project folder should have this structure:

  my-website/
    index.html
    style.css
    images/
      photo.jpg

Important: The main HTML file MUST be named index.html
GitHub Pages looks for index.html as the homepage of your site.
If your file is named something else, rename it to index.html
-->

<!--
Step 4: Connect Your Folder to GitHub Using the Terminal

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac).
Navigate to your project folder using the cd command:
-->

<!--
Terminal commands — type these one at a time:

  cd path/to/my-website

Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:

  git init

Add all your files to Git:

  git add .

Create your first commit:

  git commit -m "first commit"

Connect your local folder to the GitHub repository you created.
Copy the URL from the GitHub setup page — it looks like this:

  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-website.git

Set the branch name to "main":

  git branch -M main

Push your files to GitHub:

  git push -u origin main

After running these commands, refresh your GitHub repository page.
You should see all your files there.
-->

<!--
Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" (the gear icon near the top)
3. In the left sidebar, click "Pages"
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Under "Branch", select "main" and keep the folder as "/ (root)"
6. Click "Save"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for your site to build

GitHub will show you a message with your live URL:
  https://yourusername.github.io/my-website/

Click the link to see your published website.
-->

<!--
Step 6: Updating Your Website

Whenever you make changes to your files, follow these steps to update your live site:

1. Save your changes in your code editor
2. Open the terminal and navigate to your project folder
3. Run these commands:

  git add .
  git commit -m "describe what you changed"
  git push

4. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild your site
5. Refresh your website URL to see the updates

Tip: Write clear commit messages that describe what changed.
Good: "add contact page"
Bad: "update"
-->

Common Problems and Solutions

Problem: "My site shows a README instead of my webpage"
Solution: Make sure your main HTML file is named index.html

Problem: "My images are not showing up"
Solution: Check that image file paths are correct and use relative paths.
Use this:
-->
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="My photo">
<!--
Not this:
-->
<!-- <img src="C:/Users/me/Desktop/photo.jpg" alt="My photo"> -->
<!--

Problem: "My CSS is not loading"
Solution: Make sure your link tag uses a relative path:
-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<!--
Not an absolute path from your computer.

Problem: "My site is not updating after I pushed"
Solution: Wait 1-2 minutes. GitHub Pages can take time to rebuild.
You can check the build status under Settings > Pages in your repository.

Problem: "404 error when visiting my site"
Solution: Double check that your repository is public and that GitHub Pages
is enabled in Settings > Pages.

6.01 Activity

With a partner, review each other's GitHub repositories:
1. Can you find their index.html file in the repository?
2. Are all their CSS and image files uploaded?
3. Do the file paths in their HTML use relative paths (not absolute)?
4. Is their repository set to Public?

Share any issues you find so they can fix them before publishing.

<!--
6.01 Lab

Publish one of your previous projects to GitHub Pages:

1. Choose a project from a previous unit (your restaurant menu, personal page, etc.)
2. Make sure the main file is named index.html
3. Create a new repository on GitHub
4. Use the terminal commands from this lesson to push your project
5. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
6. Verify your site is live by visiting the URL
7. Share your live URL with your teacher

Bonus:
- Add a second page (like about.html) and link to it from index.html
- Make sure all links between pages work on the live site
