2.04 Text Formatting
-->

<!--
HTML provides several tags for formatting text:
- <strong> for important/bold text
- <em> for emphasized/italic text
- <hr> for horizontal rules/dividers

These tags provide meaning, not just visual styling.
-->

<p>This is <strong>important text</strong> that will appear bold.</p>
<p>This is <em>emphasized text</em> that will appear italic.</p>
<p>You can even <strong><em>combine them</em></strong> for bold and italic.</p>

<hr>

<p>The line above is a horizontal rule used to separate content sections.</p>

<!--Common Text Patterns -->
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This is how you might format a warning message.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This is how you might format a note or tip.</p>
<p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong> This combines both for extra emphasis.</p>
