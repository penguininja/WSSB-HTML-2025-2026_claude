5.03 Classes and IDs

5.03 Lesson
In CSS, classes and IDs let you target specific HTML elements more precisely than element selectors like p or h1.

- They are added as attributes to your HTML, just like "src" or "style". (We've already experimented with IDs for navigation!)
- An ID is used for one unique element on a page.
- In CSS, IDs start with a #
- A class can be used on multiple elements.
- In CSS, classes start with a .
- There are many strategies to naming your classes and IDs effeciently.

Example HTML
-->

<h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>

<!-- 
Example CSS

.section-heading {
  font-size: 44px;
}

-->

5.03 Lab

Lab: Multi-Page Event Website
Create a website for a fictional event (concert, tournament, festival, game night, charity event, etc.). 
The site will have two simple pages that share styles.

Pages to Create
index.html – Event overview (title, date, short description)
details.html – Event details (schedule, location, extra info)
Both pages should link to the same external CSS file.

Requirements
- Use at least two different class on multiple elements across both pages (for example: event details, info blocks, or highlighted text) and style that class in CSS.
- Use at least two unique ID per page (IDs must not repeat on the same page) to style a special element like a page title or featured section.
- Add a navigation link on each page so you can move between index.html and details.html.
- (Challenge) On one element, combine a class and an ID, then observe which styles win.
