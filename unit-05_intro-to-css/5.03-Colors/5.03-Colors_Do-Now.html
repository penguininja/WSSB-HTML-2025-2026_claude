5.02 CSS Colors - Do Now Assignment

Moving from Inline to Internal CSS

Yesterday you learned inline CSS, where you put styles directly on each element:
<p style="font-size: 20px; color: blue;">This text is blue and 20px.</p>

Today we'll learn internal CSS, where you put styles in the <head> section:

<head>
  <style>
    p { font-size: 20px; color: blue; }
  </style>
</head>

Do Now Activity:
Look at this example and think about the advantages:

INLINE CSS (what you did yesterday):
<h1 style="font-size: 32px; color: navy;">Welcome</h1>
<h1 style="font-size: 32px; color: navy;">About</h1>
<h1 style="font-size: 32px; color: navy;">Contact</h1>

INTERNAL CSS (what we'll learn today):
<style>
  h1 { font-size: 32px; color: navy; }
</style>

<h1>Welcome</h1>
<h1>About</h1>
<h1>Contact</h1>

Discussion Questions:
1. Which approach requires less typing if you have 10 headings?
2. What happens if you want to change all headings from navy to green?
3. Which approach keeps your HTML cleaner and easier to read?

Advantages of Internal CSS:
• Write once, apply to multiple elements
• Easier to make changes (change in one place affects everything)
• Cleaner HTML code
• Less repetition
• Better organization (styles are separate from content)

Today we'll learn internal CSS while exploring colors and their effects on websites.
