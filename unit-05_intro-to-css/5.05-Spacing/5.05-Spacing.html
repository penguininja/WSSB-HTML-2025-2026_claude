5.05: The CSS Box Model

In CSS, every element (like a heading, a paragraph, or a link) is treated as a rectangular box.
To make a website look professional, we use the **Box Model** to control the space around these elements.

## 1. The Four Layers of the Box

Imagine a framed picture on a wall.

- **Content:** The photo itself (the text or image on your page).
- **Padding:** The matting inside the frame (the space between the photo and the frame).
- **Border:** The wooden frame itself (the line around your content).
- **Margin:** The empty wall space *outside* the frame (the space between this picture and other pictures).

+------------------------------------------+
|  MARGIN (The outermost space)            |
|   +----------------------------------+   |
|   |  BORDER (The middle line)        |   |
|   |   +--------------------------+   |   |
|   |   |  PADDING (The inner gap) |   |   |
|   |   |   +------------------+   |   |   |
|   |   |   |     CONTENT      |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |  (Text / Images) |   |   |   |
|   |   |   +------------------+   |   |   |
|   |   +--------------------------+   |   |
|   +----------------------------------+   |
+------------------------------------------+

## 2. CSS Properties

### Padding (Inside Space)

Padding pushes the content away from the border. This prevents text from looking "cramped."

* `padding: 20px;` (Adds 20 pixels of space to all four sides)

### Border (The Edge)

The border requires three values: thickness, style, and color.

* `border: 2px solid black;`

### Margin (Outside Space)

Margin creates distance between different elements.

* `margin: 50px;` (Pushes other elements 50 pixels away from this box)

Note that margin between other boxes picks the maximum margin. Margin does not add together.

## 3. The Clockwise Rule (Shorthand)

If you want different amounts of space on different sides, you can list four numbers. CSS reads them in a clockwise direction starting from the top:

1. Top
2. Right
3. Bottom
4. Left

**Example:** `padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;`
(Top: 10px, Right: 20px, Bottom: 15px, Left: 5px)

Lab Assignment: Family Profile Page
Objective: Create a webpage featuring 3 to 5 family members (or pets/friends). Each member must have their own "Profile Card."

A Profile card should have the family members name, a picture of them, and a brief description about them.
The cards should be well spaced one after the other.

Remember using a class (like .profile-card) will help you style each profile. And should profile card should have each of the following defined:

border: A solid line (e.g., 2px solid #555).
padding: At least 20px so the text doesn't touch the border.
margin: At least 15px on the bottom so the cards don't touch each other.
background-color: Give the cards a background color that constrasts well with your main background-color, so the border is easy to find.

Very basic Profile Card:
  ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
  │ │Name                                       │ │
  │ └───────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
  │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
  │ │Picture                                    │ │
  │ └───────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
  │ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
  │ │Description                                │ │
  │ └───────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
  └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Internal Spacing
Play with the spacing inside the profile card to get the view you want. Padding/Margin/Border can all make sense here.

The "Touch" Test: Is there a clear gap (Margin) between the bottom of a profile card and the top of another card?

Bonus Challenge: Rounded Corners
To make the family cards look modern, try adding a border-radius.

This code may help you center your content:

.container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
