5.01 Lesson
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls how HTML looks.
While HTML provides structure and content, CSS provides visual styling.
Controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout

How to add CSS to HTML:
-->
<p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This text is red and 18px.</p>
<!--
- Method 1: Inline CSS (directly on elements)
- Vocabulary words: property, value, declaration.
- Notice the syntax: colon between property and value, semicolon at the end of each declaration.

Typography

Typography controls how text appears on your webpage:
- font-family: Chooses the typeface (Arial, Georgia, etc.)
- font-size: Controls text size (16px for body, 24-32px for headings)
- font-weight: Controls how heavy, or bold, text appears
- font-style: Makes text italic or normal
- color: Controls the color of the text

Font Types:
- Serif fonts (like Times, Georgia): Have small decorative strokes, traditional and formal, good for printed materials and academic websites
- Sans-serif fonts (like Arial, Helvetica): Clean and modern without decorative strokes, easier to read on screens, good for websites and apps
- Monospace fonts (like Courier): Each letter takes same space, used for code

5.01 Lab

Create a simple webpage about yourself using inline CSS:

1. Create 4-5 elements with these inline styles:
  - One heading with large font size (32px or above)
  - Two headings with medium font size (24px or above, but smaller than the large heading)
  - Two different font families
  - At least one font weight, font style, or color property

CSS properties to practice:
- font-size
- font-weight
- font-style
