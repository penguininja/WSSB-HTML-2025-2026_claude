Method 1: Inline CSS (Review)
-->
<p style="color: red;">This is red text.</p>

<!--
Method 2: Internal CSS

You can write CSS in a <style> tag inside the <head> of your HTML file.
This keeps the styling in one place.

Example:
-->
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      background-color: lightblue;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
    h1 {
      color: navy;
    }
    p {
      font-size: 18px;
      color: darkgreen;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<!--
Method 3: External CSS

For larger websites, we keep CSS in a separate file.

Steps:
1. Create a new file called style.css
2. Write your CSS rules inside it:

Example (style.css):
  h1 {
    background-color: pink;
    font-family: Georgia;
  }

3. Link the CSS file in your HTML <head>. This connects your HTML and CSS files.

Example:
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

Notes:
- CSS rules are grouped by selector, like h1, p, or body
- Each rule has property value pairs, like color: red;
- All styles apply to every element that matches that selector

Syntax reminder:
Each CSS rule starts with a selector (like p or h1),
followed by curly braces { } that hold the declarations.
Each declaration uses a property, a colon, and a value, and ends with a semicolon — for example:
-->
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 18px;
}

<!--
Why use external CSS?
- Keeps your HTML clean and easier to read
- Makes it easy to change styles across multiple pages
- Follows best practices for web development

and at least five different declarations.
