5.04 Colors and Backgrounds

A color palette is a small, intentional set of colors (often 3–5) that work
well together. This usually includes a primary color, one or two
accents, and neutral colors (white, gray, black).

Activity:
Find 2-3 color palettes online for inspiration. Try using keywords like:
- Bright
- Neutral
- Cozy

Example palettes:

Or use an image and an online palette generator:

In CSS, text color must have enough contrast against its background to be readable.
Low contrast makes text hard or impossible to read, especially for users with
low vision. A good rule of thumb is dark text on a light background or light text on
a dark background. Use a contrast checker!

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #1a1a1a;
}

Backgrounds

There are many ways to make your backgrounds more dynamic, like using gradients and images.
But make sure your text is still readable! A common, accessible pattern is to put the image
or gradient on the page (like "body") and placing content inside containers with solid
background colors.

Gradient example:

body {
  background: linear-gradient(blue, green);
}

main {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #111111;
}

-->

<!--
Background image example:

body {
  background-image: url("background.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

main {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  color: #111111;
}

Lab Assignment: Color & Contrast

Create a webpage for a school club (a sport, music group, favorite class, etc) using
a color palette with 3-5 colors. Every text element must have sufficient contrast
against its background. Include at least one section with a background color different
from the rest of the page.

Add either a gradient section or a background image. Test at least two text/background
color combinations with a contrast checker and fix any issues you find.

Bonus: Add a semi-transparent layer between the gradient and the text to increase readability.
Tip: Use the color dropper on the contrast checker to help select specific colors

Example:
.hero {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0a3d62, #60a3bc);
  color: #ffffff;
}

.hero-content {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* contrast-safe overlay */
  padding: 1rem;
}
