Lesson 5.06: Basic Layout - Flexbox and Floats

Until now, your boxes have stacked one on top of the other like a tower of blocks. Today, we learn how to put boxes side-by-side to create sidebars and professional magazine-style layouts.

1. Flexbox: The "Row" Maker
Flexbox is the modern way to align elements horizontally. You turn on "Flex" on a parent container, and all the children inside it automatically jump into a row.
How it works:
* The Parent: Set display: flex; on the container.
* The Children: They will now sit side-by-side. You can control their width using percentages (e.g., width: 70%; for a main section and width: 30%; for a sidebar).
Flexbox also has a powerful ordering property that allows you to change the order elements show up in. This can be useful for screen readers.

2. Floats: The "Newspaper" Style
Floats were originally designed for images. If you "float" an image to the left, the text will wrap around it, just like in a newspaper or a Word document.
The Code:
* float: left; — Moves the element to the left and wraps text around the right side.
* margin-right: 15px; — Crucial! Always add margin to a floated element so the text doesn't touch the image.

3. Creating a Sidebar
A common layout is the Two-Column Layout.
1. Wrap your "Main Content" and your "Sidebar" inside one div called a "wrapper."
2. Give the wrapper display: flex;.
3. Give the Sidebar a background color so it is visually (and structurally) distinct.

The Sidebar Logic
 * The Wrapper: A container that holds both the Sidebar and the Main content.
 * The Sidebar (<aside>): Usually narrow (e.g., 25% width).
 * The Main Content (<main>): Usually wide (e.g., 75% width).

Example:
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                 HEADER (Website Title)                |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  SIDEBAR (Nav)  |          MAIN ARTICLE               |
|  - Introduction |                                     |
|  - History      |      [FLOATED IMAGE]                |
|  - Fun Facts    |      Text flows around              |
|  - References   |      the image here...              |
|                 |                                     |
+-------------------------------------------------------+

Example of HTML to be ready for the CSS:
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="sidebar"></div>
  <div class="main"></div>
</div>

<div class="wrapper">
  <nav class="sidebar"></nav>
  <main class="main"></main>
</div>

<main class="wrapper">
  <aside class="sidebar"></aside>
  <article class="main"></article>
</main>


Screen Reader Note:
The order in your HTML file matters! Even if you move the Sidebar to the left visually using CSS, a screen reader will read the elements in the order they appear in the code. Usually, we put the Main Article first so the student doesn't have to listen to the navigation links every time the page loads.

Lab Assignment: The Wiki Page
Objective: Create a Wikipedia-style article about a topic of your choice (a favorite hobby, a historical event, or a tech concept). You may re-use content from a previous lab.

You will use "Accessibility-First" structuring, where the main content appears first in the code, but the navigation sidebar appears first on the screen.
1. The Layout Logic (Order vs. Source)
For users with screen readers, the most important information should come first. We will place our <main> content above our <nav> sidebar in the HTML. Then, we will use the CSS order property to swap them visually.

2. Lab Requirements
HTML Structure Requirements:
* The Wrapper: a container div (or section) that holds both the main article and the sidebar.
* Main Content your <main> tag before your <nav> tag.
* The Sidebar: a <nav> tag containing at least 3 internal links (e.g., Introduction, History, Fun Facts).
* Info Box: Inside one of your article paragraphs, include a div or an img to act as a "Quick Facts" box. At least one.

CSS Layout Notes:
* Proportions & Gaps: * Set the <nav> width to roughly 25% and the <main> width to 75%.
* Use the gap property on the wrapper to keep the columns from touching.
* Spacing: Use margin on your floated box so the text doesn't touch it.

Design & Accessibility Requirements:
* Contrast & Color: Give the sidebar a background color or border that contrasts with the main article area.
* Screen Reader Test: If you use a screen reader, it should read the Article Title and content before it reads the Sidebar navigation links.
* Keyboard Navigation: Ensure you can still "Tab" through the links in the sidebar.
