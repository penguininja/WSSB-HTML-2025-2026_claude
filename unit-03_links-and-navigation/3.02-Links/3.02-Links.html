3.02 Links
-->

<!--
HTML links allow you to navigate between pages and sections:
- The <a> tag creates links (anchor elements)
- The href attribute specifies the destination (address)
- Links can go to other pages, websites, or sections within the same page
- The link text appears between the opening and closing <a> tags

Links are fundamental to how the web works - they connect information together.
-->

<!-- Basic link to another website -->
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

<!-- Link to a section within the same page -->
<a href="#contact">Go to Contact Section</a>

<!-- Email link -->
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send Email</a>

<!-- Link with descriptive text -->
<p>For more information about HTML, please <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">visit the W3Schools HTML tutorial</a>.</p>

<!-- Example section to link to -->
<h2 id="contact">Contact Information</h2>
<p>You can reach us at our office.</p>

<!--
Best Practices for Links:
- Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context
- Avoid "click here" or "read more" without context
- Always include the href attribute

3.02 Lab

Create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" story using HTML links. Include:
- A main title (h1) and story introduction
- At least 4 different story sections with id attributes (h2 headings)
- Links within the story text that jump to different sections based on choices
- At least one external link related to your story theme
- At least one email link (maybe for story feedback or contact)
- Use descriptive link text that fits naturally in the story
- Include multiple paths through your story - readers should be able to make different choices

Story Structure Example:
- Introduction section that sets up the story and first choice
- Multiple decision points that link to different outcomes
- Different endings based on the paths taken
- A "restart" link to begin the adventure again

Example themes: Space adventure, mystery detective story, fantasy quest, time travel, school day decisions, cooking disaster, etc.
