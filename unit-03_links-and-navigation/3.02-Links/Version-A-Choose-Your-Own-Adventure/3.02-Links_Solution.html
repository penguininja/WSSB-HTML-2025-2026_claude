  <h1>The Mysterious School Locker</h1>
  
  <p>You're walking down the hallway when you notice an old, forgotten locker that's slightly open. A strange blue light is coming from inside. What do you do?</p>
  
  <p>Do you <a href="#investigate">investigate the mysterious locker</a> or <a href="#ignore">ignore it and keep walking</a>?</p>
  
  <h2 id="investigate">You Investigate the Locker</h2>
  <p>You slowly open the locker door wider. Inside, you find a glowing crystal and an old notebook filled with strange symbols. The crystal feels warm to the touch.</p>
  
  <p>Suddenly, you hear footsteps approaching. Do you <a href="#hide">quickly hide behind the locker</a> or <a href="#confront">stand your ground and see who's coming</a>?</p>
  
  <h2 id="ignore">You Ignore the Locker</h2>
  <p>You decide it's none of your business and keep walking to class. But as you reach the end of the hallway, you hear a loud CRASH behind you!</p>
  
  <p>You turn around to see the locker door has slammed shut and the blue light is gone. Do you <a href="#investigate">go back to investigate what happened</a> or <a href="#class">hurry to class and pretend you saw nothing</a>?</p>
  
  <h2 id="hide">You Hide Behind the Locker</h2>
  <p>You duck behind the locker just as your science teacher, Ms. Rodriguez, rounds the corner. She walks straight to the mysterious locker and pulls out a key!</p>
  
  <p>"I knew someone would find it eventually," she mutters, locking the locker securely. She notices you hiding and smiles. "Interested in real science mysteries? Meet me after school in the lab."</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ending:</strong> You've discovered that your teacher is involved in something mysterious! <a href="#investigate">Start the adventure over</a> to try a different path.</p>
  
  <h2 id="confront">You Stand Your Ground</h2>
  <p>A student you don't recognize approaches. They're wearing clothes that look like they're from the 1950s!</p>
  
  <p>"Finally! Someone else can see the locker," they say excitedly. "I've been trapped in this school for 70 years. That crystal is the key to getting me home. Will you help me?"</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ending:</strong> You've met a time-traveling student who needs your help! For more stories about time travel, check out <a href="https://www.scholastic.com">Scholastic's collection of adventure books</a>.</p>
