  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p>I'm currently a junior in high school with a passion for technology and learning. I've always been curious about how websites work, which led me to start learning HTML and web development.</p>
  
  <h2>My Goals</h2>
  <p>My goal is to become a skilled web developer and eventually study computer science in college. I love the creative problem-solving aspect of coding.</p>
  
  <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
  <p>This website is part of my journey to learn HTML. It's exciting to see how I can use simple code to create something that others can visit and explore.</p>
