<!--
This project builds on your Unit 2 project by expanding it into a multi-page website with navigation. 
You'll take the content from your single-page Unit 2 project and organize it across multiple connected pages.

This project combines all the skills you've learned in Unit 3:
- HTML attributes for customization
- Links for navigation between pages
- Proper website structure and organization

3.03 Unit 3 Project

Transform your Unit 2 project into a multi-page website with navigation. Take the content from your single-page Unit 2 project and reorganize it across multiple connected pages.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use your Unit 2 project content as the starting point
- Create at least 3 separate HTML pages with meaningful names (e.g., index.html, about.html, hobbies.html)
- Include consistent navigation on every page linking to all other pages
- Use proper HTML5 document structure on all pages (DOCTYPE, html, head with title, body)
- Include at least one external link to a relevant website
- Include at least one email link for contact information
- Use descriptive link text throughout (avoid "click here" or "read more")
- Apply HTML attributes where appropriate (lang attributes for foreign content, etc.)
- Maintain all the text content requirements from Unit 2:
  - Multiple heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
  - Well-written paragraphs
  - Text formatting (strong, em, hr)
  - At least one blockquote with citation
  - Both ordered and unordered lists
  - Meaningful HTML comments documenting each page

ORGANIZATION SUGGESTIONS:
- Main page (index.html): Introduction and overview
- About page: Personal background or detailed topic information  
- Content page: Your main topic content (hobbies, recipes, reviews, etc.)
- Additional pages as needed for your specific content

NAVIGATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Include the same navigation menu on every page
- Test all links to ensure they work properly
- Consider the user experience - make navigation intuitive
- Use relative links for internal pages (about.html, not full URLs)

GRADING CRITERIA:
- Technical requirements met (all HTML elements used correctly across multiple pages)
- Content quality (well-organized across pages, easy to navigate)
- Code organization (proper structure, helpful comments on each page)
- Navigation functionality (all links work, consistent across pages)
- Improvement over Unit 2 project (better organization and user experience)

This project demonstrates your ability to create a complete, navigable website that users can explore!
