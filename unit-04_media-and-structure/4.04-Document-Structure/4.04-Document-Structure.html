4.04 Document Structure

HTML5 provides semantic elements that give meaning to different sections of a webpage.
These elements help organize content and make it more accessible to all users.

Key document structure elements:
- <header>: Top section with site title, logo, or main navigation
- <main>: Primary content area of the page, only one per page
- <footer>: Bottom section with copyright, contact info, or secondary links

Basic document structure example:
-->
<html>
<body>

<header>
  <h1>Sarah's Photography Portfolio</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="#about">About</a> |
    <a href="#gallery">Gallery</a> |
    <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <p>Here you'll find my latest photography work...</p>
  <p>Additional main page content would go here</p>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2024 Sarah's Photography. All rights reserved.</p>
  <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:sarah@example.com">sarah@example.com</a></p>
</footer>

</body>
</html>
