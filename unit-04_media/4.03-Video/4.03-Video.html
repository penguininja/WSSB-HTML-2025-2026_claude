    <!-- 4.03 Video

         HTML Video adds video content to web pages:
         - The <video> tag adds an video player
         - The controls attribute adds controls for the video player
         - The nested source tag with src attribute specifies the video file location
         - The type attribute in the source tag specifies what kind of video file is being played
         - Alt text can be used to describe the video contents
         - Nested elements to the video tag show up when then video tag is not
         supported by the browser. The video tag appears to have broad adoption
         around 2011, so browsers before that time frame did not support it.

         Source Tag
         - <source> tag is used within an <video> element to specify multiple video files, which provides the browser a choice of formats to use. Similar to audio different computers/browser support different video files, and specifying multiple sources allows the browser to choose the one that works best.
         - The browser will check the <source> tags in the order they are listed and play the first file format it can support.
         - Attributes of the <source> tag
         - src: Specifies the URL of the video file.
         - type: Specifies the MIME type of the video file.

         Basic video tag with nested source tags: -->
    <p>
      <video
        controls
        width="250"
        alt="A time-lapse capture of a flower (Portulaca grandiflora?) blooming in the morning in Bangalore, India."
        poster="flower.jpg"
        >
        <source src="flower.webm" type="video/webm" />
        Download the
        <a href="flower.webm">WEBM</a>
        video.
      </video>

    <!--
        In addition to video content you host yourself, you can embed video from places like YouTube!
        This is often the easier way to add video to your websites.

        Youtube uses an iframe tag to control the embed. There are several attributes and tags that come with a youtube embedding.
        Note, embedding a youtube video requires running from a server. It cannot be configured to play when the HTML file is opened directly in your browser.
        In practice this means, the video will be a link to youtube.

        Basic youtube embedding example:
      -->
    <p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdgqPvjDxkI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>

    <!--
        Embedding from other sources also uses an iframe, and some like the following have less restrictions and can be played directly on your website when opened from a file.
        Basic wikimedia video embedding example:
      -->

    <p>Another blooming flower</p>
    <p>
      <iframe src="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Time_lapse_of_Peony_flower_blooming.webm?embedplayer=yes" width="512" height="288" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allow="autoplay; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
