4.02 Audio

HTML audio adds audio content to web pages:
- The <audio> tag adds an audio player
- The controls attribute adds controls for the audio player
- The nested source tag with src attribute specifies the audio file location
- The type attribute in the source tag specifies what kind of audio file is being played
- The nested track tag can be used to provide a transcript of the audio file
- Text shows up in the audio tag is not supported by the browser

Source Tag
- <source> tag is used within an <audio> element to specify multiple audio files, which provides the browser a choice of formats to use. Different computers/browser support different audio files, and specifying multiple sources allows the browser to choose the one that works best.
    - The browser will check the <source> tags in the order they are listed and play the first file format it can support.
- Attributes of the <source> tag
    - src: Specifies the URL of the audio file.
    - type: Specifies the MIME type of the audio file (e.g., audio/mpeg for MP3, audio/ogg for OGG). This is a crucial attribute because it allows the browser to determine if it can play the file without needing to download it first.

Track Tag
- Is a child of the <audio> element and provides timed text tracsk that can be displayed in parallel with the audio
    - Accessibility: It enables features like captions and descriptions
    - Internationalization: It allows for providing subtitles in different languages
- Key attributes of the <track> element when used with <audio>:
    - src: Specifies the URL of the text track file, typically a .vtt (WebVTT) file.
    - kind: Defines the type of text track, such as captions, descriptions, chapters, or metadata.
    - srclang: Specifies the language of the text track (e.g., en for English).
    - label: Provides a user-readable title for the track, which can be displayed in the audio player's controls for track selection.
    - default: Indicates that this track should be enabled by default if no other track is explicitly selected by the user.

Basic audio tag with nested source tags and a transcript:
-->
<audio controls>
  <source src="intro.m4a" type="audio/mpeg">
  <track
    src="intro.vtt"
    kind="transcript"
    srclang="en"
    label="English Transcript"
    >
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<section aria-labelledby="transcript-heading">
  <h2 id="transcript-heading">Transcript</h2>
