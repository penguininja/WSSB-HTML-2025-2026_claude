  <h1>Amazing Space Photography</h1>
  
  <p>Space exploration has given us incredible images that help us understand our universe. Here are some of my favorite space photographs that show the beauty and wonder of the cosmos.</p>
  
  <h2>The Pillars of Creation</h2>

  <p>This famous image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows star-forming regions in the Eagle Nebula. The towering columns are made of gas and dust where new stars are being born.</p>
  
  <h2>Earth from Space</h2>

  <p>This "Blue Marble" photograph was taken by the Apollo 17 crew in 1972. It shows our entire planet as a beautiful blue sphere floating in the darkness of space.</p>
  
  <h2>Saturn's Rings</h2>

  <p>Saturn's ring system is one of the most beautiful sights in our solar system. This image from the Cassini spacecraft shows the planet during equinox when the rings cast dramatic shadows.</p>
  
  <h2>The International Space Station</h2>

  <p>The International Space Station orbits Earth every 90 minutes. This image shows the station's solar panels and laboratory modules where astronauts live and work in space.</p>
  
  <h2>A Galaxy Far, Far Away</h2>

  <p>The Pinwheel Galaxy is located 21 million light-years from Earth. Its spiral arms contain billions of stars and show us what our own Milky Way galaxy might look like from the outside.</p>
