4.01 Images

HTML images add visual content to web pages:
- The <img> tag displays images
- The src attribute specifies the image file location
- The alt attribute provides alternative text
- Images are self-closing tags (no closing </img> needed)

Basic image with src and alt attributes:
-->
<img src="sunset.jpg" alt="A flock of Red-winged Blackbirds flying into the sunset.">

Image Attributes:
- src: The path or URL to the image file
- alt: Alternative text describing the image
- width: Sets the width in pixels (optional)
- height: Sets the height in pixels (optional)

Alt Text Best Practices:
- Describe the image clearly and concisely
- Don't start with "Image of..." or "Picture of..."
- For decorative images that don't add information, use alt=""

Discussion: What makes good alt text?

Examples:
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% from January to March 2024">
<img src="recipe.jpg" alt="Golden chocolate chip cookies cooling on a wire rack">
