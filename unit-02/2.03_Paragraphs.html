2.03 Paragraphs and Line Breaks
-->

<!--
HTML provides tags for organizing text:
- <p> for paragraphs
- <br> for line breaks

Paragraphs automatically add spacing between blocks of text.
-->

<p>Your text goes here</p>
<p>Here is some more text!</p>

<!--
- Each paragraph starts on a new line
- Browsers add spacing between paragraphs automatically
- Just like paragraphs in Word
-->

<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>

<!--
Break Tag
- Breaks to a new line
- Does not need a closing tag
- Use sparingly - paragraphs are usually better

<p>This is a haiku.<br>It uses a paragraph<br>and there are line breaks.</p>
