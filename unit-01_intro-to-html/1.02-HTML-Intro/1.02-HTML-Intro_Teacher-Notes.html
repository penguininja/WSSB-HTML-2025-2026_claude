What is HTML?
- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
- It's the standard language for creating web pages
- HTML describes the structure and content of web pages
- HTML uses "tags" to mark up content
- Tags label content such as headers, paragraphs, and links

What are HTML Tags?

HTML uses "tags" to structure and define content. Tags tell the browser what
each piece of content is and how it should be displayed.

Tag Structure:
- Tags are enclosed in angle brackets < >
- Most tags come in pairs: opening tag <tag> and closing tag </tag>
- The content goes between the opening and closing tags
- Some tags are self-closing and don't need a closing tag
- Nested tags use indentation (2 spaces)

Example: <h1>This is a heading</h1>
- <h1> is the opening tag
- </h1> is the closing tag (note the forward slash)
- "This is a heading" is the content

<!-- Basic HTML Document Structure -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>This is my first paragraph of text on the web.</p>
  <p>HTML tags help organize and structure my content.</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--
Document Structure Explanation:

<!DOCTYPE html> - Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document
<html> - The root element that contains all content
<head> - Contains information about the page (not visible to users)
<title> - Sets the title that appears in the browser tab
<body> - Contains all visible content on the page
<h1> - A large heading
<p> - A paragraph of text

Every HTML document follows this basic structure!
