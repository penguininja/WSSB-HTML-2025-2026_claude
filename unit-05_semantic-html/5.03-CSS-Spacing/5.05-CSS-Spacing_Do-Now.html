5.05 CSS Spacing - Do Now Assignment

Discussion Starter
Think about how space affects your reading experience.

Questions to consider:
- What makes text easier to read - when it's all crammed together or when it has breathing room?
- How do you feel when you open a document with wall-to-wall text vs. one with good spacing?
- What's the difference between reading a newspaper (tight spacing) vs. a magazine (more spacing)?

Quick Exercise
Compare spacing in different documents.

Your task:
1. Look at two different websites or documents
2. Notice the spacing:
   - How much space is between paragraphs?
   - How much space is around the edges of content?
   - How close together are different sections?
3. Which one feels more comfortable to read?

Example observations:
- Cramped: "Text goes right to the edge, paragraphs run together, feels overwhelming"
- Well-spaced: "Content has room to breathe, sections are clearly separated, easier to focus"

Time limit: 3 minutes

Note: Today we'll learn CSS spacing properties that make content readable and professional-looking.
