5.03 CSS Introduction - Do Now Assignment

Discussion Starter
Think about different websites you've visited and how they look.

Questions to consider:
- What makes one website look more professional than another?
- How do fonts affect how you feel about a website?
- What's the difference between reading text on a plain webpage vs. a nicely designed one?

Quick Exercise
Compare two websites - one very plain and one with nice styling.

Your task:
1. Open any two websites (like a basic school page vs. a modern news site)
2. Notice differences in:
   - Font sizes and styles
   - Colors used
   - How spaced out everything looks
3. Which one is easier to read? Why?

Example observations:
- Plain site: "All text looks the same size, black text on white background"
- Styled site: "Different sized headings, nice colors, text has breathing room"

Time limit: 3 minutes

Note: Today we'll learn CSS - the tool that transforms plain HTML into beautiful, professional-looking websites.
