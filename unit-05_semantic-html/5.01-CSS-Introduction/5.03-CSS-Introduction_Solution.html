    <h2>About My Photography</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my photography portfolio! I've been passionate about photography for over five years, specializing in landscape and portrait photography.</p>
    
    <p class="italic-text">Photography isn't just about capturing what you see – it's about capturing what you feel in that moment.</p>

      <h3>Latest Project: Mountain Landscapes</h3>
      <p>My recent trip to the Rocky Mountains provided incredible opportunities for landscape photography. <span class="bold-text">The early morning light created magical conditions</span> that I'd never experienced before.</p>
      
      <p class="elegant">Each sunrise brought new colors and textures that transformed the mountainous landscape into something truly extraordinary.</p>

      <h3>Portrait Photography Philosophy</h3>
      <p>When photographing people, I believe in creating a comfortable environment where natural expressions can emerge.</p>
      
      <p class="italic-text">The best portraits happen when people forget they're being photographed.</p>

    <h3>Photography Tips</h3>
    <p>Some lessons I've learned along the way:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Golden hour lighting makes everything look better</li>
      <li class="italic-text">Composition is more important than expensive equipment</li>
      <li class="bold-text">Practice consistently, even if it's just for 15 minutes a day</li>
      <li>Study the work of photographers you admire</li>
    </ul>
