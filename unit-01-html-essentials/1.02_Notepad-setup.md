3. Right arrow and down to "cmd"
4. JAWS will read path
5. Type `@echo off` for turning off reading path every time

#### Running the File
1. Type `python` and name of file
2. **Up arrow** will go back to the previous command

## Tips and Notes

### Indentation
- You will not hear the indent if the indent is the same as the previous line
- Unless you tell JAWS to read the line

### Auto-indent Issue
For the life of me I cannot get Notepad++ to auto-indent Python, even with Auto-indent turned on
