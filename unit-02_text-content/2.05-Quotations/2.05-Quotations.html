2.05 Quotations
-->

<!--
HTML provides tags for including quotations and citations:
- <blockquote> for longer quotations that stand apart from the main text
- <cite> for citing the source of a quotation or work

These tags provide semantic meaning, not just visual styling.

<blockquote>
  <p>The only way to do great work is to love what you do.</p>
  <cite>Steve Jobs</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>As <cite>Steve Jobs</cite> once said, passion is essential for excellence in any field.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.</p>
  <cite>Albert Einstein</cite>
</blockquote>

<!--
Best Practices:
- Use <blockquote> for quotations that are separate from the main text flow
- Use <cite> to identify the source, author, or work being referenced
- <blockquote> can contain paragraphs and other elements
- <cite> is typically used inline within text
