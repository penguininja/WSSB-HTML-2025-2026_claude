2.05 Quotations
-->

<!--
HTML provides tags for including quotations and citations:
- <blockquote> for longer quotations that stand apart from the main text
- <cite> for citing the source of a quotation or work

These tags provide semantic meaning, not just visual styling.

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sometimes you have to play a long time to be able to play like yourself.”</p>
  <cite>Miles Davis</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I am building a fire, and every day I train, I add more fuel. At just the right moment, I light the match.”</p>
  <cite>Mia Hamm</cite>
</blockquote>

<!--
Best Practices:
- Use <blockquote> for quotations that are separate from the main text flow
- Use <cite> to identify the source, author, or work being referenced
- <blockquote> can contain paragraphs and other elements
- <cite> is typically used inline within text
