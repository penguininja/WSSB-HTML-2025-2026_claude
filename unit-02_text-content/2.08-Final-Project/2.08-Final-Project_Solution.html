  <h1>My Journey in Photography</h1>
  
  <p>Welcome to my photography journey! I'm <strong>Alex</strong>, a high school student who discovered a passion for capturing moments through the lens. What started as casual phone photos has evolved into a <em>serious hobby</em> that brings me joy every day.</p>

  <p>Photography has taught me to see the world differently. Instead of rushing past beautiful moments, I now <em>slow down</em> and appreciate the details that make each scene unique.</p>

  <!-- Favorite photography styles -->
  <h2>Photography Styles I Love</h2>
  
  <p>Different types of photography challenge me in unique ways. Each style requires <strong>different techniques</strong> and helps me grow as a photographer.</p>

  <h3>Portrait Photography</h3>
  <p>Capturing people's personalities in photos is both challenging and rewarding. I love how a good portrait can tell someone's story in a single frame.</p>

  <h3>Landscape Photography</h3>
  <p>There's something <em>magical</em> about photographing nature. Early morning hikes to catch the perfect sunrise have become some of my favorite adventures.</p>

  <!-- Inspiration section with blockquote -->
  <h2>Photography Inspiration</h2>
  
  <p>One of my favorite photographers, <strong>Ansel Adams</strong>, perfectly captured why I love this art form:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"You don't take a photograph, you make it."</p>
    <cite>Ansel Adams</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This quote reminds me that photography is about <em>creating something meaningful</em>, not just pointing and clicking. Every photo is a chance to share how I see the world.</p>

  <!-- Future goals section -->
  <h2>Future Photography Goals</h2>
  
  <p>Photography continues to challenge and inspire me. Here are some goals I'm working toward:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Learn more about manual camera settings</li>
    <li>Try wildlife photography at local nature preserves</li>
    <li>Create a photography portfolio for college applications</li>
    <li>Enter a local photography contest</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <h3>Why Photography Matters to Me</h3>
  
  <p>Photography has become more than just a hobby - it's changed how I experience life. Whether I'm capturing a <strong>perfect sunset</strong> or a candid moment with friends, my camera helps me preserve memories that would otherwise fade away.</p>

  <p>If you're thinking about trying photography, my advice is simple: start now! You don't need expensive equipment or perfect skills. Just grab whatever camera you have and begin exploring the world through your own unique perspective.</p>
