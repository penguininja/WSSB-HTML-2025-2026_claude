  <h1>Blog Post: My First Concert Experience</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>When I was in high school, I went to my first concert at <strong>The Gorge Ampitheater</strong>, and it was an
    <em>unforgettable</em> experience. <strong>Beyonce</strong> and <strong>Buddy Holly</strong> opened for
    <strong>Nina Simone</strong> and hearing them live gave me chills. I realized how <em>powerful</em>
    music can be.</p>

  <h2>The Songs</h2>

  <p><strong>Beyonce</strong> performed songs like <em>Single Ladies</em> and <em>Texas Hold 'Em</em>. I like
    her new country album a lot.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>Buddy Holly</strong> sang songs like <em>Everyday</em> and <em>Maybe Baby</em>. The Classics.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>Nina Simone</strong> played songs like <em>Feeling Good</em> and <em>I Put a Spell on You</em>.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

  <p>Overall, I had an <em>amazing</em> experience and I would defintiely go to a live concert again!</p>

    it's a way of life,
    it's a way of being,
    a way of thinking."
