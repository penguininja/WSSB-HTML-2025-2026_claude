- Comments start with <!-- and end with -->

<!-- They are invisible to website visitors but visible in the source code
- Use comments to explain complex code and document the purpose of sections
- You can use comments to temporarily hide code without deleting it
- Comments can be used to keep track of tasks that still need to be done using TODO

2.07 Lab

Create an "under construction" website for any topic you choose. Include:
- At least 2 completed sections with content
- At least one inline comment (single line)
- At least one multi-line comment
- A "commented out" section to show it's "under construction"
- At least one TODO item
- Helpful comments explaining what you're working on

Make your website look intentionally incomplete to practice using comments!
