2.06 Lists
-->

<!--
HTML provides tags for creating structured lists:
- <ul> for unordered (bulleted) lists
- <ol> for ordered (numbered) lists
- <li> for individual list items within both types

These tags help organize content in a clear, accessible way.
-->

<ul>
  <li>Guitar</li>
  <li>Piano</li>
  <li>Drums</li>
  <li>Violin</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Turn on the computer</li>
  <li>Open your web browser</li>
  <li>Navigate to your favorite website</li>
  <li>Enjoy browsing!</li>
</ol>

<!--
Nested Lists:
Lists can be nested inside other lists to create hierarchical structures.
-->

<ul>
  <li>Breakfast
    <ul>
      <li>Pancakes</li>
      <li>Scrambled eggs</li>
      <li>Orange juice</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lunch
    <ul>
      <li>Sandwiches</li>
      <li>Salad</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dinner
    <ul>
      <li>Grilled chicken</li>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Steamed vegetables</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
Best Practices:
- Use <ul> for lists where order doesn't matter (features, items, ingredients)
- Use <ol> for lists where sequence is important (steps, rankings, instructions)
- Always wrap list items in <li> tags
- Lists can contain other HTML elements like links, emphasis, etc.

2.06 Lab

Take your recipe from lesson 2.03 and improve it by converting appropriate content to lists. Update your recipe webpage to include:
- Keep your main page structure like headings and paragraphs
- Use at least one unordered list (ul)
- Use at least one ordered list (ol)
- Think about what parts of your recipe would work better as lists than paragraphs

This will make your recipe much easier to read and follow!
