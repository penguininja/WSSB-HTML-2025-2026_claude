2.06 Lists
-->

<!--
HTML provides tags for creating structured lists:
- <ul> for unordered (bulleted) lists
- <ol> for ordered (numbered) lists  
- <li> for individual list items within both types

These tags help organize content in a clear, accessible way.
-->

<ul>
  <li>First unordered item</li>
  <li>Second unordered item</li>
  <li>Third unordered item</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>First ordered item</li>
  <li>Second ordered item</li>
  <li>Third ordered item</li>
</ol>

<!--
Nested Lists:
Lists can be nested inside other lists to create hierarchical structures.
-->

<ul>
  <li>Main topic
    <ul>
      <li>Subtopic A</li>
      <li>Subtopic B</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Another main topic</li>
</ul>

<!--
Best Practices:
- Use <ul> for lists where order doesn't matter (features, benefits, ingredients)
- Use <ol> for lists where sequence is important (steps, rankings, instructions)
- Always wrap list items in <li> tags
- Lists can contain other HTML elements like links, emphasis, etc.
